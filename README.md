# Mini Sponsorship System
This app serves as a CLA version of https://github.com/VelasquezTracy25/sponsorship-system. 

This system will accept a league submission in form of function parameters and write them to an existing list.

It will also pass parameters to sponsor leagues, taking in coordinates, a radius, and a budget amount to calculate the max amount of teams an organization can sponsor.

## Installation

This project can be run from the Main class. Mulitple tests have been added that can be commented out to check functionality.
